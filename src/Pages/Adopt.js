            <p>Did you cuddle with one of our fur babies and you just want to take him/her home? Our animals are available for adoption!
                We do have some requirements to make sure our babies go into good homes. We do require the <b>entire family</b> to be
                part of the adoption process. This helps prevent personality differences causing our animals to return to us. By meeting
                before taking a dog or cat home, we verify the family and animal is a good match from the beginning. (This goes along with
                any other animals in the home).
            </p>
            <p>We do also require all potential adopters to be 18 years of age or older and be able to prove the animal is allowed in your
                home. This can be done by owning your own home, showing apartment/home rental agreement, or signed consent from your
                landlord.
            </p>
            <p>If you are still interested in adoption please contact us at adopt@cuddleco.com.</p>
