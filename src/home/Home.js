                        <p>Welcome to Cuddle Co! Our mission is to help support the animals in our care with some
                            much needed love and cuddles from our members.  Cuddle Co was founded 4 years ago by 
                            Emily Perkins, since then it has grown to include 12 furbabies, each available for
                            adoption, even though it breaks our hearts. While we strive to give the best home
                            life possible to each animal in our care, we do understand that have a home with an
                            individual family is much less stressful on our babies. </p>

                        <p>At Cuddle Co we strive to make each experience memorable and unique. With our rooms designed for
                            comfort, we try to make as relaxing a visit as possible. Having set rooms for each animal to visit also allows 
                            our pets to stay in a comfortable and known environment even though the people may change. Ocelot lynx tiger
